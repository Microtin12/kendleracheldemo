This is a wedding registry website that I have created for my wedding coming up in a few months
To create this website, I have been teaching myself how to code and here it is. 
Its very rough and needs a lot of work to make the code easier to read but it works and Im proud of it.
You can use this code if you'd like but I would not recommend it because it is supper inefficent.
Thanks for taking the time to read this and have a wonderful day.
